# Introduction

Piper is a distributed workflow engine designed to be dead simple.

In Piper, work to be done is defined as a set of tasks called a Pipeline. Pipelines can be sourced from many locations but typically they live on a Git repository where they can be versioned and tracked.

# Tasks

Tasks are the basic building blocks of a pipeline. Each task has a `type` property which maps to a `TaskHandler` implementation, responsible for carrying out the task.

For example here's the `RandomInt` `TaskHandler` implementation:

```
  public class RandomInt implements TaskHandler<Object> {

    @Override
    public Object handle(Task aTask) throws Exception {
      int startInclusive = aTask.getInteger("startInclusive", 0);
      int endInclusive = aTask.getInteger("endInclusive", 100);
      return RandomUtils.nextInt(startInclusive, endInclusive);
    }
    
  }
```

While it doesn't do much beyond generating a random integer, it does  demonstrate how a `TaskHandler` works. a `Task` instance is passed as  an argument to 
the `TaskHandler` which contains all the Key-Value pairs of that task.

The `TaskHandler` is then responsible for executing the task using this input and optionally returning an output which can be used by other pipeline tasks downstream.
